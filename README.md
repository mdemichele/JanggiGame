# Janggi Game
This project is an implementation of an abstract board game called Janggi. A good explanation of the rules of the game can be found on [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janggi).

The project was created as my portfolio project for CS 162 Introduction to Computer Science II at Oregon State University. 

The class definition of the Janggi Game is nearly complete. There are a few loose ends that I need to fix in order for the game to be playable. I'll eventually finish the class definition and build out a GUI to play the game on a local machine.
